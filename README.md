# TorToiSe TTS API

Please :star: this repo if you want us to open-source it! This helps us prioritize!

**NOTE: It is currently still a work-in-progress and is not completely ready yet, but we have a MVP**

## HOW IT WORKS

Coming soon!

## BEFORE YOU GET EXCITED

Yes, there's a huge drawback to this.

**To run this, you'll need powerful GPUs.** So... If you don't have an A10G (or better), you won't probably reach real-time speeds with the streaming and will likely have delays between chunks.

## MOST DIFFICULT PARTS

Implementing live-streaming was by far the most difficult part, since yielding audio chunk-by-chunk can be difficult.

**We previously tried (and failed) to make an earlier version, but this new (V2) API now works!**
